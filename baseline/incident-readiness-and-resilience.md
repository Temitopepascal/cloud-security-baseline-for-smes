# Incident Readiness, Backup, and Resilience Baseline

## Objective
The objective of this baseline is to ensure that SMEs are prepared to respond to security incidents and recover from service disruption with minimal impact to business operations.

Many organisations focus on prevention but fail to plan for response and recovery. This baseline establishes simple, practical controls that support resilience without requiring dedicated incident response teams.

---

## Core Principles
- Security incidents are inevitable; preparation reduces impact
- Clear roles and procedures matter more than complex tools
- Backups must be tested, not just configured
- Recovery processes should be understood before an incident occurs

---

## Baseline Requirements

### 1. Incident Readiness
- Define clear responsibility for incident coordination and decision-making
- Maintain an up-to-date inventory of critical systems and data
- Establish a simple incident response process covering detection, containment, and recovery
- Ensure contact details for key stakeholders are readily available

---

### 2. Access Control During Incidents
- Restrict administrative access during incidents to authorised responders
- Monitor privileged activity closely during incident handling
- Revoke or rotate credentials suspected of compromise

---

### 3. Backup Strategy
- Maintain regular backups of critical systems and data
- Ensure backups are stored separately from primary environments
- Protect backup storage from unauthorised modification or deletion

---

### 4. Backup Testing and Validation
- Test backup restoration processes periodically
- Verify that backups can be restored within acceptable timeframes
- Document restoration procedures and dependencies

---

### 5. Business Continuity and Recovery
- Identify systems required to maintain essential business operations
- Define recovery priorities and acceptable downtime
- Ensure recovery plans are accessible during incidents

---

## Implementation Notes
SMEs should prioritise defining ownership and validating backups as initial steps.

Incident response procedures should be simple, documented, and understood by relevant staff.

---

## Expected Outcomes
When implemented correctly, this baseline should:
- Reduce downtime during incidents
- Improve confidence in recovery capabilities
- Limit the impact of security breaches
- Support operational resilience and continuity
