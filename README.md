# Cloud Security Baseline for Small and Medium-Sized Enterprises (SMEs)

## Purpose
This repository provides a practical, opinionated cloud security baseline designed to help small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) establish a secure foundation when operating workloads in public cloud environments.

The baseline focuses on controls that materially reduce risk while remaining achievable for organisations without dedicated security teams.

---

## Who This Is For
This baseline is intended for:
- SMEs with approximately 10–500 employees
- Organisations using Amazon Web Services (AWS) and/or Google Cloud Platform (GCP)
- Teams seeking clear, security-by-default guidance rather than exhaustive compliance frameworks

---

## Problem Statement
Many SMEs adopt cloud services rapidly to support business growth, but security is often implemented reactively rather than by design.

This leads to inconsistent access controls, limited visibility, manual security processes, and increased exposure to preventable security incidents.

This baseline addresses the absence of a clear, practical security foundation that SMEs can realistically implement and maintain.

---

## Scope
This baseline defines minimum recommended controls across the following areas:
- Identity and Access Management (IAM)
- Network Security and Segmentation
- Logging, Monitoring, and Visibility
- Secure Configuration Standards
- Incident Readiness and Response
- Backup, Recovery, and Resilience

---

## Out of Scope
This baseline does not aim to:
- Replace full compliance frameworks (e.g. ISO 27001)
- Provide exhaustive platform-specific hardening guides
- Cover advanced SOC or threat-hunting operations
- Prescribe specific commercial security products

---

## Design Principles
- Identity-first security
- Secure-by-default configurations
- Practical controls over theoretical perfection
- Automation where feasible
- Clarity and maintainability over complexity

---

## Author & Background
This baseline is informed by over a decade of experience in enterprise IT infrastructure, cloud security, and system architecture.

The author’s background includes acting leadership responsibility for IT operations, the delivery of data centre and network infrastructure projects, and hands-on experience designing and securing cloud environments across on-premises, hybrid, and multi-cloud platforms.

## Status
**Version:** 0.1

This is an initial public release. The baseline will evolve based on practical feedback and real-world adoption.
